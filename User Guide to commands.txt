------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. To add a task, you can use one of the following ways.

	add <task>		//Simply put add in front
	add <task with time>	
	<task> add		//Add can be the last word
	<task with time> add
	<task>			//Add can be omitted
	<task with time>

2. To delete a task, you have to specify the task's index
number that you want to delete. Otherwise, you have to specify 
the kind of tasks that you want to delete. If neither the index
not the task type is specified, delete cannot be done. You can use the following commands.

	delete <index>		//Delete followed by the index
	<index> delete		//Index followed by delete
	delete <i j k>		//Delete followed by multiple indices.
	<i j k> delete		//Multiple indices followed by delete.
	delete <task type>	//Delete followed by the task type
	<task type> delete	//Task type followed by delete

	*i j k are examples of the tasks' indices separated by spaces

	*delete all		//Similar to clear but can be undone

3. To edit a task, an index needs to be specified which must
either follow the edit command on the second position or be on the
first position if the edit command is behind. Otherwise, if no index
is found, it will edit the last task which was modified (tailed with a star). You can edit a task through the following ways.
	
	edit <index> <task>	//Edits the task
	edit <index> <time>	//Edits the time of the task
	edit <index> <task with time> // edits both the task and time
	<index> <task> edit 	//Edit can be behind with index in front
	<index> <time> edit
	<index> <task with time> edit

4. To view the task list, there are 11 default commands
	
	view all		//View all the tasks
	view float		//View all the floating tasks
	view deadline		//View all the timed tasks
	view overdue		//View tasks which are overdue
	view completed		//View all completed tasks
	view uncompleted 	//View all uncompleted tasks
	view today		//View today's tasks
	view tomorrow		//View tomorrow's tasks
	view thisweek		//View this week's tasks (this 7 days)
	view nextweek		//View next week's tasks (next 7 days)
	view thismonth		//View this month's tasks 
	
	*Of course, the two words are interchangeable like:
	 all view, float view, today view...
	
	*view			//View alone will invoke view all.

5. To undo a last move, you can simply type undo. However, there are also other variations.

	undo			//Default: undo 1 time
	undo <index>		//Undo <index> times
	undo all		//Undo until the first move	
	<index> undo 		//Interchangeable words
	all undo

6. To redo an undone move, you can simply type redo. Other variations also exists.
	
	redo			//Default: redo 1 time
	redo <index>		//Redo <index> times
	redo all 		//Redo until your recent change
	<index> redo		//Interchangeable words
	all redo

7. To check a task as done, just type complete for the task. Index must
be specified. Otherwise, it will just checks the task with recent change (tailed with star) as done.

	complete <index>	//Checks the task at index as completed
	complete <task type>	//All the tasks of the type is checked
	complete <i j k> 	//Checks tasks at multiple indices
	<index> complete	//Interchangeable words
	<task type> complete
	<i j k> complete

	complete		//Checks the task with recent change

8. To uncheck a task if it was checked done, just type uncomplete. Similar to complete, index must be specified or the task with recent change will be unchecked even if it was already unchecked.

	uncomplete <index>	//Unchecks the task at index
	uncomplete <task type>	//All the tasks of the type is unchecked 
	uncomplete <i j k>	//Unchecks tasks ar multiple indices
	<index> uncomplete	//Interchangeable words
	<task type> uncomplete
	<i j k> uncomplete

	uncomplete		//Unchecks the task with recent change

9. To search for a task, you have to specify the key words of the task.

	search <key words>	//search for the key words in task list
	<key words> search	//Interchangeable words

10.To clear the whole task list, just a simple clear can do it. This command however, cannot be undone.

	clear			//Clears the whole task list.

11.The time entered by default cannot be a time which is in the past. It can follow either of the formats shown. They are more intuitive.
	
	1 May 2015		//Specify year if it's not current year
	Dec 27			//If in words, day and month can change
	next sat		//Intuitive natural language
	New Year		//Can specify a celebration
	2pm			//Must specify am or pm for time
	4:35am			//Colon is needed for minutes' accuracy
	Morning			//Defaults to 8am
	Afternoon		//Defaults to 12pm
	Evening			//Defaults to 7pm
	Night			//Defaults to 8pm
	
		
	The programme recognises digital time format but in American date format.
	11/29/2014		//American date format. MM/DD/YYYY

	A deadline task's time cannot be a time before now. But the starting time of a timed task can be before now. The starting time must follow the starting date or the date will be set default as today.
	from 5 May 6pm to 7pm	//5 May 6pm to 5 May 7pm
	3pm to 4pm next Sat 	//today 3pm to next Saturday 4pm
	2pm - tomorrow 5pm	//today 2pm to tomorrow 5pm
	1am mon to wed		//Monday 1am to Wednesday 1am
	

	Sometimes, you may not have the intention of stating a time but the programme misinteprets it. Use a quotation mark over the time statement so that it is ignored
	"Day after Tomorrow"	//Movie
